# MTA Subway Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `MTA_subway.ipynb`, which analyzes and models subway data to derive insights and make predictions. It leverages Python for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles categorical and numerical data.
   - Standardizes features using `StandardScaler`.

2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Implements regression and classification models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor and Classifier
     - Decision Tree
     - K-Nearest Neighbors

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - R-squared score (R²)

4. **Visualization**:
   - Uses `matplotlib` for plotting and analyzing results.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

##Install dependency
